    question: "Do I need to connect my wallet or provide private keys?",
    answer: "Absolutely not. BitSleuth only requires a public Bitcoin address to work. Your keys and funds are never at risk.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my search data stored or tracked?",
    answer: "No, all lookups are transient and anonymous by default. We do not store your search history unless you explicitly choose to save an analysis in a future version.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support the Lightning Network?",
    answer: "Not yet. Our focus is currently on on-chain Bitcoin transactions. Lightning Network support is on our long-term roadmap.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the AI analysis?",
    answer: "Our AI is trained on vast amounts of public blockchain data to identify patterns and risks. While it provides powerful insights, it should be used as a supplementary tool and not as financial advice."
